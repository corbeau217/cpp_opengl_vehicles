## development environment details

* `MacOS` - the operating system this project is developed on
* `VSCODE` - the IDE that this project is developed in
* `OpenGL` - graphics framework used to make this project
* `C++` - main language that the project is written in
* `GLAD` - OpenGL function pointer wrapper
* `GLFW` - window event handle wrapper
* `GLM` - math handle library for vectors/matrices
* `opengl_project_structurings` - the template repository this project is made from (refactored version of example OpenGL code)

## development iterations and conditions

* conditions of development will be that this does not interfere with studies of repository maintainers and is meant as an artistic project
* design aims of this project are that it facilitates exploration of different engineering practices, OpenGL as a frame work, and C++ as a language
* as C++ is not taught as a primary language in the university that the creator of this project attends, there will be certain features that exist in C++ which are not an option in development for someone with more experience in java.
* there will be times where development may be halted due to the restriction of chosen resources and ever the chance that development may be halted indefinitely with little warning.
* whilst the project does have the potential to showcase certain talents, this will be an ongoing battle to avoid thinking about and to dodge it becoming too much about the showcasing and not enough about the art and creative drive/freedom that the medium presents the creator.
    * likely causes for project development death will be the aforementioned "showcasing", as too much attention can heighten unnecessary negative criticism, self-sabotage to avoid the spotlight, and over-estimation of abilities.
* development will attempt to take an iterative approach but more likely will end up being "Near-sighted Spaghetti Demon" due to the concepts involved
* were the creator patient and scheming enough, this could very easily be adapted to be a thesis project rather than a creative project, but that would cause similar concerns as before and likely assassinate motivation in working on it

## notes on preliminary designing

* a lot of the conceptual design notes already covers a lot of this, and this stage is kinda broadly skipped so far, but inclusions/exclusions as well as dependency matrix should first be made to highlight a realistic development plan and "attempt" to avoid complexity demon ruining the [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) of this art project

## notes on different terms

### Gamification

* [wiki page about Gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification)
* but honestly we use this as the idea to cognitively turn this project into an artwork / game to be conquered so that the development is less likely to halt.
* what if development were more gamified as to avoid *the complexity demon* and *the engineering anti-fun monster*

### the engineering anti-fun monster

* not sure if this is an existing idea, but a similar one to *the complexity demon*
* to summarise, this is just the idea that some projects tend to get bogged down by engineering documentation and the overall intent for everything to be a new dotpoint on one's portfolio
* sometimes, projects suffer by having them being made into mountains by the very strict and rigorous "anti-fun" of the engineering design process which makes all deviation from "the garden path", out to be an illegal, very serious criminal offense, and punishable by low grades on your design aspect of the learning and sentencing to some engineering jail house where you sit and think about the evil miss-deeds you've committed while other engineers frown at you if you ever make eye contact. Continuing this way until such time as you ascend to be an agile-shaman who makes immaculate documentation, regardless of if the project was a success.
