[**[Back to Contents]**](#contents)

* [***click here to goto [Docs 00 Overview]***](./docs_00_overview.md)
* repo is for experimenting with vehicles in opengl and c++
* in part this project is an attempt at exploring and experimenting with what a term like `Computer Graphics Engineering` would mean

## Notes 

[**[Back to Contents]**](#contents)

* yoinks the stuff from our template
* check out [the documentation overview](./docs_00_overview.md) for different documentation thingies
* please know that the main creater of this documentation forgets the names of the things
    * some of the names of the things in documentation may be incorrectly used
    * as this project is for fun, as revision, and for the practice of the tools, there is less emphasis on documentation being 100% correct it in use, and more emphasis on the practicallity of the documentation in a software design and engineering basis for graphical art.
