## notes on preliminary designing

* a lot of the conceptual design notes already covers a lot of this, and this stage is kinda broadly skipped so far, but inclusions/exclusions as well as dependency matrix should first be made to highlight a realistic development plan and "attempt" to avoid complexity demon ruining the [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) of this art project
